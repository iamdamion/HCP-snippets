## Background
Working with HCP files has been an adventure. There are many resources out there and the workbench commands are very powerful. However, while attempting to complete many tasks I would simply and quickly do using fsl commands on volume files, I found myself a little confused with surface/HCP files. I was constantly searching for brief and simple examples or step-by-step instructions for the tasks I was trying to complete...but was unable to find them. If you are anything like me, you learn best by clear and brief step-by-step examples that offer real outputs you can then experiment with and build upon.

This repository is meant to be a living resource for people in the position I was in. Those searching for simple step-by-step instructions and examples commands or code to build upon for your work. Hopefully, it will mitigate the struggle for grad students and new workbench and HCP users.

## Please Contribute!!
If you'd like to contribute any brief tutorials or tips you wish you'd have known when you started working with HCP pipeline output files or workbench commands, please write something up. We have provided a [template markdown file](https://github.com/iamdamion/HCP-snippets/blob/main/md_files/template.md) and any images should be linked from the /img folder in this repository. Submit a pull request and we'll get it added asap. We've all learned a lot from scattered resources, but I'm hoping this can evolve into something that can reduce that learning curve pain for new grad students.
